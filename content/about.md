**Hello, I'm Robin 👋**

I am a **Senior Front-end Engineer** with over **7 years** of experience crafting high-performance digital products. My career has been shaped by leading teams and architecting complex systems at industry leaders like **ByteDance** and **Xiaomi**.

I believe that **code is the bridge between human imagination and digital reality.** For me, engineering is not just about solving tickets; it’s about using technology to build seamless, intuitive experiences that empower users.

**🛠 Technical Expertise**

My expertise lies in designing scalable architectures and optimizing performance for complex mobile environments (**H5, Hybrid, and React Native**). I am deeply committed to solid engineering practices and performance tuning, ensuring teams can ship better products, faster.

While my core is in **React and TypeScript**, I also possess **full-stack experience** developing **B2B cloud platforms** with **Node.js**. Beyond the UI, I have a keen interest in **algorithms**, a topic I frequently dive into in my blog posts.

**🎨 Beyond the Editor**

I am a **multi-passionate creator** who thrives on learning new things. When I’m not diving into a codebase, you’ll likely find me:

- **Capturing stories** through my camera lens (Photography) 📷.
- **Expressing thoughts** through writing and exploring the world of cinema 🎬.
- **Staying active** through sports and practicing the discipline of **Ballet** 🩰.
- **Strategizing** on the chessboard—I’m currently sharpening my tactics on **Duolingo Chess** ♟️.
